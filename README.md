### 👋 Hi, I’m Emily, I started learning to code through curiosity and just as a hobby. Now I'm upskilling myself to jump into a complete career change!

👩‍💻 I started my front-end journey with [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/users/55813-emily-mason) , and would love a paid internship or junior role to hone my skills in the workplace.<br/>
🤓 I’ve recently relocated from the UK to sunny Spain, when I'm not on the beach, I'm gaming, moderating, experimenting with new ideas for my [online shop](https://supersoniceuro.etsy.com).<br/>
