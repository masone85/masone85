### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Emily! <br/>

A curious and creative problem-solver transitioning into a tech career after discovering my passion for coding. What began as a hobby has transformed into a journey of upskilling and embracing a new professional path in technology.

üë©‚Äçüíª My front-end development journey started with SheCodes, where I built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. I‚Äôm continuing to expand my skills, aiming to contribute to innovative web and app projects while exploring exciting possibilities in tech. My ultimate goal is to create impactful user experiences and, perhaps one day, delve into game development.

üöÄ I‚Äôm eager to take on a dynamic role where I can put my imagination, technical knowledge, and problem-solving abilities to good use. Whether it‚Äôs in client-focused solutions, tech consulting, or collaborative development teams, I‚Äôm ready to grow and contribute to projects that make a difference.

üåû Recently relocated from the UK to sunny Spain, I balance my time between exploring the beautiful coastline, gaming, moderating online communities, and experimenting with ideas for my online shop.
